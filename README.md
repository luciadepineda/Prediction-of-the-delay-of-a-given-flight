## Prediction of the delay of a given flight

This project consists in predicting whether a given flight will be delayed or not, given the information of the scheduled departure. Therefore, the objective is to classify each flight as delayed or not delayed, which is a binary classification.

The dataset used to carry out this project is the Airlines Dataset. The source of this dataset is the Data Expo Competition (2009), it is inspired by the regression dataset from Elena Ikonomovska (http://kt.ijs.si/elena_ikonomovska/data.html). The original data consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008. For our dataset, the task was downsampled to 5 percent.

The instructions to execute our code files are:
1) For the first part (preprocessing, visualization of the data and clustering) run the R Markdown code provided. This code will create a new dataset with the processed data.
2) Then, run the Python notebook (.ipynb) for the modeling and predictions part. Executing all the cells the results will be shown.
